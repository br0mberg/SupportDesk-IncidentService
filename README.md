## Overview
The Incident Service is a key component of the support automation system, designed to manage and process user-reported incidents. This microservice enables functionalities like creating, viewing, editing, and deleting incidents, along with assigning priorities, categories, and responsible departments.

## Features
- Create, view, edit, and delete incidents.
- Assign categories, statuses, priorities, and analysts to incidents.
- Notify administrators of new incidents and handle asynchronous image deletion via Kafka.
- Integrate seamlessly with other microservices such as the User Service and Image Service.
- Authenticate with JWT Bearer.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21+**
- **Spring Boot** for core application framework.
- **PostgreSQL** as the relational database.
- **Liquibase** for database migration.
- **Lombok** and **Mapstruct** for reducing boilerplate code.
- **Kafka** for asynchronous communication.
- **Kafka UI** for message management.
- **gRPC** for synchronous communication.
- **Spring Data** for database interactions.
- **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization.
- **Keycloak** for authentication and JWT token generation.
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerization and orchestration.
- **Swagger** for REST API documentation.
